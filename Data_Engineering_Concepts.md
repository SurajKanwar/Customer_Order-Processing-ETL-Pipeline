- **Batch Processing**: Processing data in scheduled intervals.
- **Real-time Processing**: Processing data streams continuously.

## Tools Overview
- **SQL**: Query and manipulate structured data.
- **Python**: Automate data transformations.
- **Airflow**: Orchestrate workflows for ETL pipelines.
- **Spark**: Process large datasets using distributed computing.
- **Docker**: Create isolated environments for deployment.
